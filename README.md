# Meetup Archiver: Dashboard

The project was developed at Simon Fraser University by Alberto Lusoli and Frederik Lesage. This work was supported by the the SSHRC Institutional Grant Program: "Mapping the Vancouver Start up Economy".

Thanks to DewHoney Ventures for their support in developing the project and to the Simon Fraser Research Computing Group for their help in releasing the code into the public domain.
